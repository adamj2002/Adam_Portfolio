# The 6 troubleshooting steps

### 1. Understand the Issue

- Gather Information: Ask the user or review tickets to understand the problem clearly. 
- Clarify symptoms, affected systems, and when the issue started.
Replicate the Problem: If possible, try reproducing the issue to observe it firsthand. This will help you understand its scope and severity.

### 2. Check the Basics
- Connectivity & Power: Ensure the device is powered on and connected to the network. Check physical connections, such as cables, switches, or routers.
- System Logs & Alerts: Review system logs for error messages or warnings that indicate a problem. Also, check monitoring tools for alerts.

### 3. Verify System Configurations
- Settings Review: Ensure system settings (network, permissions, software configurations) are correct and consistent with company policies.
- Patch & Update Status: Check if the system is current with the latest patches and updates, as outdated software can often cause issues.

### 4. Isolate the Problem
##### - Component Testing:
- To isolate the issue, test individual components (e.g., hardware, network segments, services). For example, use ping tests, replace hardware, or disable services one by one.
- Environment Comparison: To identify discrepancies, compare the problematic system with a working system.

### 5. Implement a Solution
- Apply Fixes: Based on the diagnosis, apply the appropriate fix, whether restarting a service, changing a configuration, replacing a component, or reinstalling software.
- Document Changes: Record any changes made, including configurations, fixes applied, and the rationale behind them for future reference.

### 6. Test & Verify
- Verify Resolution: Test the system thoroughly to ensure the issue is resolved and no new issues have been introduced.
- User Confirmation: Have the user test the system and confirm that the problem has been resolved satisfactorily.


# Troubleshooting Scenario

### 1. Understand the Issue

- Gather Information: The user reports that they cannot access a network drive that they usually connect to daily. They mentioned that the issue started this morning after restarting their computer.
- Replicate the Problem: Attempt to access the network drive from the user's workstation. Confirm that the drive is inaccessible and note any error messages, such as "Network path not found" or "Access denied."

### 2. Check the Basics

- Connectivity & Power: Verify that the user's computer is connected to the network. Check the network icon in the system tray to ensure it’s online and connected.
- System Logs & Alerts: Check the Event Viewer for any network-related errors or warnings that occurred when the issue was reported. Also, verify that no alerts have been triggered in the network monitoring system that could indicate a broader network issue.

### 3. Verify System Configurations
##### - Settings Review:

- Network Drive Mapping: Ensure the network drive is correctly mapped on the user’s machine. Check the path, drive letter, and credentials used for the mapping.
- Permissions: Verify that the user still has the appropriate permissions on the network share. You can do this by reviewing Active Directory permissions or checking directly on the file server.
- Patch & Update Status: Confirm that the user's operating system and network drivers are up to date, as outdated software can sometimes cause connectivity issues.

### 4. Isolate the Problem
##### - Component Testing:

- Network Test: Ping the file server from the user’s computer to confirm network connectivity. If the ping fails, further investigate network issues, such as checking the switch port or VLAN assignment.
- Credential Test: Try accessing the network drive using a different account (e.g., a test account) to determine if the issue is account-specific.
- Compare Environment: Test access to the network drive from a different computer on the same network. If the other computer can access the drive, the issue is likely with the user’s computer or account.

### 5. Implement a Solution
##### - Apply Fixes:

- Remap the Network Drive: If the mapping is incorrect, delete the existing mapping and remap the drive using the correct path and credentials.
- Correct Permissions: If the issue was caused by incorrect permissions on the network share, update the user’s permissions.
- Update Network Drivers: If the network drivers are outdated, update them to the latest version.
Document Changes: Record all changes, including the steps to resolve the issue, any updates applied, and the user’s credentials or permissions adjustments.

### 6. Test & Verify
##### - Verify Resolution:

- Have the user log off and back in, then test the network drive to ensure it is accessible. Ensure that the drive maps correctly and that files can be opened, edited, and saved without issues.
- User Confirmation: Ask the user to confirm that the network drive is functioning as expected and that they have no further issues.
